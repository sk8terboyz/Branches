# Branches

Shane Kennedy

Programming Languages Used: HTML, JavaScript

This code is a recreation of the branching system used here: https://mrdoob.com/#/111/branching

I recreated this branching system because I got intrigued by how it worked. This is just my introduction into the graphical capabilities of JavaScript and HTML canvas. I hope to produce a series of these recreations and eventually go on to make my own original content, but I have much to learn before I feel comfortable doing that.
