# Branches

Shane Kennedy

Programming Languages Used: HTML, JavaScript

This code is a recreation of the branching system used here: https://mrdoob.com/#/111/branching

I recreated this branching system because I got intrigued by how it worked. 
This is just my introduction into the graphical capabilities of JavaScript and HTML canvas, so if there are issues with the code, don't blame me. 
I hope to produce a series of these recreations and eventually go on to make my own original content, but I have much to learn before I feel comfortable doing that.
